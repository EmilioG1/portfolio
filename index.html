    <h3>My Background</h3>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio page. My name is Emilio and I'm currently enrolled as a student at Epicodus. Up until the beginning of this class I had worked in the brewing industry for about 6 years. I'm looking forward to this new journey into the web and software development world.</I></p>
    <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
    <p>Some of my <strong>Favorite</strong> things include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Travel. Yes, I know it's cliche! I personally love visiting new places and experiencing new cultures through the lens of food, art, sport, music, lifestyle; the list goes on. Some of my favorite memories are from...</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Italy - Siena, Rome, Lake Como</li>
        <li>France - Paris, Normandy</li>
        <li>Armenia - Yerevan, Lake Sevan, </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Nature. I truly love getting outside and taking my dog hiking in the mountains.</li>
      <li>Reading. Mainly Sci-Fi and general fiction. An extremely-abridged list of personal recommendations:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Spaceman of Bohemia</li>
        <li>The Lonesome Gods</li>
        <li>The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy</li>
        <li>Rain of Gold</li>
        <li>Cannery Row</li>
        <li>Name of the Wind</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Sports. Both Eropean and American football, which I enjoy playing and watching. Possibly <em>too</em> much!</li>
      <li>Beer, wine, and whiskey. Yes, even though I'm out of the industry I still like to geek out on fermented beverages. And yes, the humble lager is <em>indeed</em> the best beer style.</li>
      <li>Most importantly, my dog, <strong>Kodi</strong>. Being able to spend more time with him is one of the biggest factors that led to my career change.</li>
    </ul>
